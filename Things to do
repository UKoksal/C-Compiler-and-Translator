How do curly braces solve the dangling else problem?
Do I need to still push 4 registers if there are less than 4 arguments?
Return values of loops etc?
Signed and unsigned multiplication and division do we need the u versions?
Check what goes in the condition of while and if.
Noticed a weird nop and andi with less than what is that about?

Almost certain about this but are right shifts undefined?
What sets c90 apart, is it a subset of c++ so are they identical for our intents?
What's up with break in division and the bne?


Removing conditionals removed 1 conflict,
removing the second rule for a factor removed another.


Empty parameter list in function call causes segfault

There seems to be a problem when I declare variables later on, this code for example results in incorrect frame allocation for a and b. I think this is illegal for c90 though
int main() {
 int b;
 int c;
 c = 5;
 b = fib(69);
 if(c == 5){
   return b;
 }
}
int fib(int n){
  if(n == 1){
    return 1;
  }else{
    if(n == 2){
      return 13;
    }else{
        int a;
        int b;
        a = n - 1;
        b = n - 2;
      return a;
    }
  }
}

 b = fib(12, 5,3,4, 5, 6)-2; problem with the space with the minus here

Do we need to worry about coercing types in a switch statement, do we need to ensure that what follows a case is a constant expression?
Make sure array declarations can have constant expressions
